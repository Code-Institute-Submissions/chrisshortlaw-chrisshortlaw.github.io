# Atomic Fitness

A static, single-scrolling website to promote a local gym. 

Deploying bold, energetic colours with sleek fonts and intuitive user-experience, the site will supply information to existing members whilst providing an easy entry point for new and potential members. Key parts of the site will be an impressive landing page detailing the various classes, profiles of the gym instructors and their personal training philosophies, a site highlighting events and 'challenges' members can participate in (e.g. A daily step competition (Winner gets 3 months free membership), a weight-loss challenge, a 5 kg to 50kg power-lifting challenge), and a sign-up form. Other pages will be comprised of a gallery, a weekly time-table (static), and a membership price list.
 
## UX
 

### Product Owner: Mark, Owner of Atomic Fitness

> I opened Atomic Fitness in 2015. 
> The gym has been successful through word-of-mouth and an active social media presence (facebook, twitter & instagram).
> We offer classes as well as personal training (group and one-to-one).
> Yet, some larger fitness chains have opened in the locality over the past two years.
> This coincides with the completion of several new housing estates and apartment complexes.
> This means an influx of newcomers to the area and increased competition for their business along with regulars being attracted to competitor gyms.
> I want a website to attract new clients. I need a slick design to compete with the larger franchises and brand-names.
> Our gym is class-based which appeals to those who are new to fitness or would be uncomfortable working out on their own. 
> A unique selling point is that the gym is well-situated in a local park which is walking distance for most people.
> There is also ample parking. I want to communicate this convenience and unique locale whilst also presenting a product that is stylish enough to match the larger competition.
> The goal here is to reach a wider audience than social media, achieve more sign-ups and participation in challenges.
> I would also like to up-sell existing clients from regular classes to personal training.
> Most members pay by cash in person but I would like the ability to take payments over the site in the future.
> Most member also use their phones for facebook & instagram and would probably browse my website on mobile too.
> Consequently, good design for mobile screens is a must.


### User Story 1: Marie

> I have been going to Atomic Fitness for 6 months.
> I find using facebook and instagram for discovering information about the gym to be inconvenient. Sometimes it is hard to tell what is old, expired content and what is still relevant.
> I want a website where I can check the weekly class schedule for the gym,
> see the price list, and find out what challenges are going on in the gym.
> I would primarily view the site on my mobile phone.


### User Story 2: Martin

> I am new to the area and want to explore what amenities are nearby like gyms and parks.
> I dislike social media as I am concerned about my privacy and I do want to be tied to using multiple apps on my phone or tablet.
> I would use search engines to discover information about my local area
> I would want any website to tell me where the gym is, what services it offers, the price.
> I would be more likely to sign up if there was an easily accessible and convenient way online.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Landing page: single scrolling page with bright title/hero image, callouts for promotions & challenges, quotes from happy members, scrolling to section focussing on location & images, section on services (with link to class time-table/info page) section on gym instructors/trainers, terminating with a sign-up form.
    - Nav Bar: located on header allows easy navigation between different pages and sections on landing page. Consider nested menu.
    - Header: Bold colours which will be consistent across pages and possibly fixed scrolling on landing page.
    - Footer: consistent across pages to reinforce theme of site. Links to social media.
- Classes/About Page: tells users about services in detail, elaborates on landing page section. Contains time-table covering the week.
- Price List: Simple, static price list.
- Challenges page: Lists 'challenges' and promotions. Include 'leaderboard' for challenges (styled table).
- Gallery: Reinforces happy members. Tiled images รก la pinterest.


## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
    - This page will use _Bulma_ CSS, an open source CSS framework.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
