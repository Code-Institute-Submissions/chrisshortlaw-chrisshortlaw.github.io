# Atomic Fitness

This will be a static, single-scrolling website to promote a local gym.

In this project, I shall experiment with Bulma, and endeavour to create an attractice and responsive website using html & css and minimal javascript.

Deploying bold, energetic colours with sleek fonts and intuitive user-experience, the site will supply information to existing members whilst providing an easy entry point for new and potential members. Key parts of the site will be an impressive landing page detailing the various classes, profiles of the gym instructors and their personal training philosophies, a site highlighting events and 'challenges' members can participate in (e.g. A daily step competition (Winner gets 3 months free membership), a weight-loss challenge, a 5 kg to 50kg power-lifting challenge), and a sign-up form. Other pages will be comprised of a gallery, a weekly time-table (static), and a membership price list.
 
## UX
 

### Product Owner Epic: Mark, Owner of Atomic Fitness

> I opened Atomic Fitness in 2015. 
> The gym has been successful through word-of-mouth and an active social media presence (facebook, twitter & instagram).
> We offer classes as well as personal training (group and one-to-one).
> Yet, some larger fitness chains have opened in the locality over the past two years.
> This coincides with the completion of several new housing estates and apartment complexes.
> This means an influx of newcomers to the area and increased competition for their business along with regulars being attracted to competitor gyms.
> I want a website to attract new clients. I need a slick design to compete with the larger franchises and brand-names.
> Our gym is class-based which appeals to those who are new to fitness or would be uncomfortable working out on their own. 
> A unique selling point is that the gym is well-situated in a local park which is walking distance for most people.
> There is also ample parking. I want to communicate this convenience and unique locale whilst also presenting a product that is stylish enough to match the larger competition.
> The goal here is to reach a wider audience than social media, achieve more sign-ups and participation in challenges.
> I would also like to up-sell existing clients from regular classes to personal training.
> Most members pay by cash in person but I would like the ability to take payments over the site in the future.
> Most member also use their phones for facebook & instagram and would probably browse my website on mobile too.
> Consequently, good design for mobile screens is a must.


### User Epic: Marie

> I have been going to Atomic Fitness for 6 months.
> I find using facebook and instagram for discovering information about the gym to be inconvenient. Sometimes it is hard to tell what is old, expired content and what is still relevant.
> I want a website where I can check the weekly class schedule for the gym,
> see the price list, and find out what challenges are going on in the gym.
> I would primarily view the site on my mobile phone.


### User Epic: Martin

> I am new to the area and want to explore what amenities are nearby like gyms and parks.
> I dislike social media as I am concerned about my privacy and I do want to be tied to using multiple apps on my phone or tablet.
> I would use search engines to discover information about my local area
> I would want any website to tell me where the gym is, what services it offers, the price.
> I would be more likely to sign up if there was an easily accessible and convenient way online.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
    - This page will use _Bulma_ CSS, an open source CSS framework.

- [Glassmorphism](https://[insert url here])
    - The glassmorphism technique was deployed as a flourish.




## Testing

### Responsiveness:

Testing for responsiveness was carried out throughout the project using FireFox's developer tools. The site is mobile first, focussing on the iphone 5 SE as the standard (320px by 568px) and scaling upwards from there. 

Chromium based browsers were also used to test features and compatibility. These consisted of Chromium on a Linux machine and Microsoft Edge (Chromium based: version 90.0.818.42) on a Windows machine.

Some features, such a glassmorphism use features which are disabled by default on FireFox and are unavailable on older browsers such as Internet Explorer. These were either turned off when using those browsers or left undisturbed where there was no discernible loss of quality or experience.

The project was tested and found to be compatible with multiple screen size up to tablet (786px by  XXX ) and desktop (1920 by 1080). Viewing and usability was possible in both portrait and landscape mode.




1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment


Deployed on Github Pages.
